# Chapter 1 - The Theme

> “I’m not going to requisition a new typewriter. The new ones are made of tin. There was an accident in the subway this morning, their brackets wouldn’t work. You ought to go home, Eddie, turn on the radio and listen to a good dance band. Forget it, boy. Trouble with you is you never had a hobby. Somebody stole the electric light bulbs again, from off the staircase, down where I live. I’ve got a pain in my chest. Couldn’t get any cough drops this morning, the drugstore on our corner went bankrupt last week. The Texas-Western Railroad went bankrupt last month. They closed the Queensborough Bridge yesterday for temporary repairs. Oh well, what’s the use? Who is John Galt?” [^1]

> In her pause of startled anger, the fireman chuckled. “Last week, the crack special of the Atlantic Southern got left on a siding for two hours– just somebody’s mistake.” [^2]

> "You realize, of course, that a lengthy procedure will be necessary to put this through,“ he said; the words sounded almost hopeful. “It isn’t as simple as that.”
“Oh sure,” she said. I’ll send you a detailed report, which Eddie will prepare and which you won’t read. Eddie will help you to put it through the works. I’m going to Philadelphia tonight to see Rearden. He and I have a lot of work to do.” She added, “It’s as simple as that, Jim”. [^3]

> “Would you take my word for it that I decided to offer you the post[^4] I’m going to offer, before you asked to see me? I want you to know that.”
“I will always take your word, Miss Taggart.”
“It’s the post of Superintendent of the Ohio Division. It’s yours, if you want it.”
His face showed no reaction, as if the words had no more significance for him than for a savage who had never heard of railroads.
“I don’t want it, Miss Taggart,” he answered. [^5]

> “Why?” she asked, not addressing him. 
He stopped. He shrugged and smiled– he was alive for a moment and it was the strangest smile she had ever seen: it held secret amusement, and heartbreak, and an infinite bitterness. He answered: “Who is John Galt?” [^5]
