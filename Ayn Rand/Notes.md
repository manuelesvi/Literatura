# Chapter 1 - The Theme

> “I’m not going to requisition a new typewriter. The new ones are made of tin. There was an accident in the subway this morning, their brackets wouldn’t work. You ought to go home, Eddie, turn on the radio and listen to a good dance band. Forget it, boy. Trouble with you is you never had a hobby. Somebody stole the electric light bulbs again, from off the staircase, down where I live. I’ve got a pain in my chest. Couldn’t get any cough drops this morning, the drugstore on our corner went bankrupt last week. The Texas-Western Railroad went bankrupt last month. They closed the Queensborough Bridge yesterday for temporary repairs. Oh well, what’s the use? Who is John Galt?” [^1]

> In her pause of startled anger, the fireman chuckled. “Last week, the crack special of the Atlantic Southern got left on a siding for two hours– just somebody’s mistake.” [^2]

> "You realize, of course, that a lengthy procedure will be necessary to put this through,“ he said; the words sounded almost hopeful. “It isn’t as simple as that.”
“Oh sure,” she said. I’ll send you a detailed report, which Eddie will prepare and which you won’t read. Eddie will help you to put it through the works. I’m going to Philadelphia tonight to see Rearden. He and I have a lot of work to do.” She added, “It’s as simple as that, Jim”. [^3]

> “Would you take my word for it that I decided to offer you the post[^4] I’m going to offer, before you asked to see me? I want you to know that.”
“I will always take your word, Miss Taggart.”
“It’s the post of Superintendent of the Ohio Division. It’s yours, if you want it.”
His face showed no reaction, as if the words had no more significance for him than for a savage who had never heard of railroads.
“I don’t want it, Miss Taggart,” he answered. [^5]

> “Why?” she asked, not addressing him. 
He stopped. He shrugged and smiled– he was alive for a moment and it was the strangest smile she had ever seen: it held secret amusement, and heartbreak, and an infinite bitterness. He answered: “Who is John Galt?” [^5]

# Chapter 2 - The Chain

> An oncoming freight train hid the view, filling the windows with a rushing smear of noise. In a sudden break above the flat cars, the passengers saw distant structures under a faint, reddish glow in the sky; the glow moved in regular spasms, as if the structures were breathing. [^6]

> The metal came rising to the top of the ladle and went running over with arrogant prodigality. Then the blinding white trickles turned to glowing brown, and in one more instant they were black icicles of metal, starting to crumble off. The slag was crusting in thick, brown ridges that looked like the crust of the earth. As if the crust grew thicker, a few craters broke open, with the white liquid still boiling within. [^7]

> The road was dark, edged with trees. Looking up, he could see a few leaves against the stars; the leaves were twisted and dry, ready to fall. There were distant lights in the windows of houses scattered through the countryside; but the lights made the road seem lonelier. [^8]

> –the acts of self-racking when he discarded a hope or a sample, not permitting himself to know that he was tired, not permitting himself to know that he was tired, not giving himself time to feel, driving himself through the wringing of: “not good enough . . . still not good enough . . .” and going on with no motor save [^9] the condition that it could be done. [^10]

> –these were things that had come to white heat, had melted and fused within him, and their alloy was a strange, quiet feeling that made him smile at the countryside in the darkness and wonder why happiness could hurt. [^11]

> After a while, he realized that he was thinking of his past, as if certain days of it were spread before him, demanding to be seen again. He did not want to look at them; he despised memories as a pointless indulgence. But then he understood that he thought of them tonight in honor of that piece of metal in his pocket. Then he permitted himself to look. [^12]

> He saw the day when he stood on a rocky ledge and felt a thread of sweat from his temple down his neck… He stood, cursing himself, because he had made up to his mind that he would not be tired. After a while, he went back to his task; he decided that pain was not a valid reason for stopping. [^12]

> He saw an evening when he sat slumped [^13] across his desk in that office. It was late and his staff had left; so he could lie there alone, unwitnessed. He was tired. It was as if he had run a race against his own body, and all the exhaustion of years, which he had refused to acknowledge, had caught him at once and flattened him against his desk top. He felt nothing, except the desire not to move. He did not have the strength to feel –not even to suffer. He had burned everything there was to burn within him; he had scattered so many sparks to start so many things–and he wondered whether someone could give him now the spark he needed, now when he felt unable ever to rise again. He asked himself who had started him and kept him going. Then he raised his head. Slowly, with the greatest effort of his life, he made his body rise until he was able to sit upright with only one hand pressed to the desk and a trembling arm to support him. He never asked that question again. [^14]

> As he touched it, he realized suddenly that he had thought of an abstraction called “his wife” –not of the woman to whom he was married. He felt a stab of regret, wishing he had not made the bracelet, then a wave of self-reproach for the regret. [^15]

> He shook his head. This was not the time for his old doubts. He felt that he could forgive anything to anyone, because happiness was the greatest agent of purification. He felt certain that every living being wished him well tonight. He wanted to meet someone, to face the first stranger, to stand disarmed and open, and to say, “Look at me.” People, he thought, were as hungry for a sight of joy as he had always been– for a moment’s relief from that gray load of suffering which seemed so inexplicable and unnecessary. He had never been able to understand why men should be unhappy. [^15]

> “--but it’s just that a man of culture is bored with the alleged wonders of purely material ingenuity,” she was saying. “He simply refuses to get excited about plumbing.” [^16]

> “You’re not sorry. You could’ve been here if you’d made the effort. But when did you ever make an effort for anybody but yourself? You’re not interested in any of us or in anything we do. You think if you pay the bills, that’s enough, don’t you? Money! That’s all you know. And all you give us is money. Have you ever given us any time? [^17]

> They were all watching his face; if they expected a look of guilt, what they saw, instead, was a faint smile of amusement. She could not have intended this as a trap, he thought, because he could escape it so easily, by refusing to accept any blame for his forgetfulness and by leaving her spurned; she knew that his feeling for her was her only weapon. Her motive, he thought, was a proudly indirect attempt to test his feeling and to confess her own . . . He had to let her win, he thought, because she had thrown herself upon his mercy. [^18]

> She jingled the bracelet, making it sparkle under the light. "Henry, it's perfectly wonderful! What originality! I shall be the sensation of New York, wearing jewelry made of the same stuff as bridge girders, track motors, kitchen stoves, typewriters, and --what was it you were saying about it the other day, darling?--soup kettles? [^19]

> "The intention's plain selfishness, if you ask me," said Rearden's mother. "Another man would bring a diamond bracelet, if he wanted to give his wife a present, because it's her pleasure not his own. But Henry thinks that's just because he's made a new kind of tin, why, it's got to be more precious than diamonds to everybody, just because it's he who has made it. [^20]

> He had never asked anything of them; it was they who wished to hold him, they who pressed a claim on him-- and the claim seemed to have the form of affection, but it was a form which he found harder to endure than any sort of hatred. He despised causeless affection, just as he despised unearned wealth. They professed to love him for some unknown reason and they ignored all the things for which he could wish to be loved. He wondered what response they could hope to obtain from him in such manner--if his response was what they wanted... Why that chronic air of suspicion, as if they were waiting to be hurt? He had never had a desire to hurt them, but he had always felt their defensive, reproachful expectation; they seemed wounded by the mere fact of his being. Don't start imagining the insane--he told himself severely, struggling to face the riddle with the strictest of his ruthless sense of justice. He could not condemn them without understanding; and he could not understand. [^21]

> What would happen to Henry's vanity if he didn't have us to throw alms to? What would become of his strength if he didn't have weaker people to dominate? What would he do with himself if he didn't keep us around as dependents? [^22]

> She took the metal bracelet and held it up, letting it glitter in the lamplight. . . "A chain," she said. "Appropriate, isn't it? It's the chain by which he holds us all in bondage. [^23]

# Chapter 3 - The Top and The Bottom

> Disunity, that’s the trouble. It’s my absolute opinion that in our complex industrial society, no business enterprise can succeed without sharing the burden of the problems of other enterprises. [^24]

> “It’s been proved that every business depends upon every other business.” said Orren Boyle. “So everybody ought to share the burdens of everybody else.” [^25]

> “My purpose”, said Orren Boyle, “is the preservation of a free economy. It’s generally conceded that free economy is now on trial. Unless it proves its social value and assumes its social responsibilities, the people won’t stand for it. If it doesn’t develop a public spirit, it’s done for, make no mistake about that.” [^26]

> The only justification of private property is public service. [^27]

> “When everybody agrees,” . . . “when people are unanimous, how does one man dare to dissent? By what right? That’s what I want to know– by what right? [^28]

> “The public has a vital stake in natural resources, Jim, such as iron ore. The public can’t remain indifferent to reckless, selfish waste by an anti-social individual. After all, private property is a trusteeship held for the benefit of society as a whole.” [^29]

> “There’s nothing more destructive than a monopoly, on the one hand. On the other, there’s the blight of unbridled competition . . . The proper course is always, in my opinion, in the middle. So it is, I think, the duty of society to snip the extremes, now isn’t it?” [^30]

> “If everybody could pull for a common purpose, then nobody would have to be hurt!” [^31]

> “I can’t be expected to buck the trend of the whole world, can I?” . . . “You can’t Mr. Larkin,” said Wesley Mouch. “You and I are not to be blamed, if we–” [^32]

> “Speaking of progressive policies, Orren,” said Taggart, “you might ask yourself whether at a time of transportation shortages, when so many railroads are going bankrupt and large areas are left without rail service, whether it is in the public interest to tolerate wasteful duplication of services and the destructive, dog-eat-dog competition of newcomers in territories where established companies have historical priority.” [^33]

> “It all depends,” James Taggart answered slowly, “on knowing the people who make it possible . . . That’s what has to be known– who makes it possible” [^34]

> It was only in the first few years that she felt herself screaming silently, at times, for a glimpse of human ability, a single glimpse of clean, hard, radiant competence. She had fits of tortured longing for a friend or an enemy with a mind better than her own. But the longing passed. She had a job to do. She did not have time to feel the pain; not often. [^35]

> In a corner of the concourse, by the main entrance, there was a small newsstand. The owner, a quiet, courteous old man with an air of breeding, had stood behind his counter for twenty years. He had owned a cigarette factory once, but it had gone bankrupt . . . He had a hobby which was his only pleasure; he gathered cigarettes from all over the world for his private collection; he knew every brand made or that had ever been made. Dagny liked to stop at his newsstand on her way out. He seemed to be part of the Taggart Terminal, like an old watchdog too feeble to protect it, but reassuring by the loyalty of his presence. He liked to see her coming, because it amused him to think that he alone knew the importance of the young woman in a sports coat and a slanting hat, who came hurrying anonymously through the crowd. [^36]

>>> 
“Do they ever think?” she asked involuntarily, and stopped; the question was her one personal torture and she did not want to discuss it.
He said, “I don’t like the thing that’s happening to people, Miss Taggart.”
“What?”
“I don’t know. But I’ve watched them here for twenty years and I’ve seen the change. They used to rush through here, and it was wonderful to watch, it was the hurry of men who knew where they were going and were eager to get there. Now they are hurrying because they are afraid. It’s not a purpose that drives them, it’s fear. They’re not going anywhere, they’re escaping. And I don’t think they know what it is that they want to escape. They don’t look at one another. They jerk when brushed against. They smile too much, but it’s an ugly kind of smiling: it’s not joy, it’s pleading[^37]. I don’t know what it is that’s happening to the world.” He shrugged. “Oh, well, who is John Galt?” [^38]

# Chapter 4 - The Immovable Movers

> She felt a dim touch of anxiety. She was back from a trip to the plant of the United Locomotive Works in New Jersey, where she had gone to see the president of the company in person. She had learned nothing: neither the reason for the delays nor any indication for the date when the Diesel engines would be produced. The president of the company had talked to her for two hours. But none of his answers had connected to any of her questions. His manner had conveyed a peculiar note of condescending reproach whenever she attempted to make the conversation specific, as if she were giving proof of ill-breeding by breaking some unwritten code known to everyone else. [^39]

>>>
She turned to a phonograph and put on a record of the music of Richard Halley.

It was his Fourth Concerto, the last work he had written. The crash of its opening chords swept the sights of the streets away from her mind. The Concerto was a great cry of rebellion. It was a “No” flung at some vast process of torture, a denial of suffering, a denial that held the agony of the struggle to break free. The sounds were like a voice saying: There is no necessity for pain –why, then, is the worst pain reserved for those who will not accept its necessity?--we who hold the love and the secret of joy, to what punishment have we been sentenced for it, and by whom? . . . The sounds of torture became defiance, the statement of agony because a hymn to a distant vision for whose sake anything was worth enduring, even this. It was the song of rebellion–and of a desperate quest. [^40]
>>>

> She wandered aimlessly about the room. “I don’t want to go home,” she said with no particular feeling. “I hate morning. Here’s another day and nothing to do. I’ve got a tea session on for this afternoon at Liz Blane’s. Oh well, it might be fun, because Liz is a bitch.” She picked up a glass and swallowed the stale remnant of a drink. “Why don’t you have them repair your air-conditioner? This place smells. [^41]

> The nature of their relationship had the same quality. There was no passion in it, no desire, no actual pleasure, not even a sense of shame. To them, the act of sex was neither joy nor sin. It meant nothing. They had heard that men and women were supposed to sleep together, so they did. [^42]

>>>
“I’m glad to report, however, that I foresaw the possibility of such events and took every precaution to protect the interests of Taggart Transcontinental. Some months ago, I instructed our Operating Department to cut the schedule of the San Sebastián Line down to a single train a day, and to remove from it our best motive power and rolling stock, as well as every piece of equipment that could be moved. The Mexican government was able to seize nothing but a few wooden cars and one superannuated locomotive. . . I would suggest, therefore, that we request the resignation of Mr. Clarence Eddington, our economic consultant, who recommended the construction of the San Sebastián Line, and of Mr. Jules Mott, our representative in Mexico City.”

The men sat around a long table, listening. They did not think about what they would have to do, but of what they would have to say to the men they represented. Taggart’s speech gave them what they needed. [^43]
>>>

> The National Alliance of Railroads was an organization formed, it was claimed, to protect the welfare of the railroad industry. This was to be achieved by developing methods of co-operation for a common purpose; this was to be achieved by the pledge of every member to subordinate his own interests to those of the industry as a whole; the interests of the industry as a whole were to be determined by a majority vote, and every member was committed to abide by any decision the majority chose to make. [^44]

>>>
“Against whom is this Alliance being organized?”… “it’s against shippers or supply manufacturers or anyone who might try to take advantage of us. Against whom is any union organized?”

When the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule was offered to the vote of the full membership of the National Alliance of Railroads at its annual meeting, it was the first mention of this Rule in public. But all the members had heard of it; it had been discussed privately for a long time, and more insistently in the last few months. The men who sat at the large hall of the meeting were the presidents of the railroads. They did not like the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule; they had hoped it would never be brought up. But when it was brought up, they voted for it. [^45]
>>>

> The man who entered was a stranger. He was young, tall, and something about him suggested violence, though she could not say what it was, because the first trait that one grasped about him was a quality of self-control that seemed almost arrogant. He had dark eyes, disheveled hair, and his clothes were expensive, but worn as if he did not care or notice what he wore.
“Ellis Wyatt”, he said in self-introduction. [^46]

> “You can listen to an ultimatum” … “If the snide stunt you people perpetrated on the Phoenix-Durango was done for the purpose of saving yourself from the necessity of effort, this is to give you notice that you will not get away with it. I made no demands on you when you could not give me the kind of service I needed. I found someone who could. Now you wish me to force me to deal with you. You expect to dictate terms by giving me no choice. You expect to hold my business down to the level of your incompetence. This is to tell you that you have miscalculated.” … “Those who wish to deal with me, must do so in my terms or not at all. I do not make terms with incompetence.” [^47]

> “That's right. They won’t. When I heard about that Anti-dog-eat-dog business, it made me sick. But don’t worry about the goddamn bastards.” The two words sounded shockingly violent, because his face and voice remained calm. “You and I will always be there to save the country from the consequences of their actions.” He got up; he said, pacing the office, “Colorado isn’t going to be stopped. You’ll pull it through. Then Dan Conway will be back, and others. All that lunacy is temporary. It can’t last. It’s demented, so it has to defeat itself. You and I will just have to work a little harder for a while, that’s all.” [^48]

# Chapter 5 - The Climax of The D'Anconias

> Sebastián d’Anconia, his ancestor, had left Spain many centuries ago, at a time when Spain was the most powerful country on earth and his was one of Spain’s most proudest figures. He left, because the lord of Inquisition did not approve of his manner of thinking and suggested, at a court banquet, that he change it. Sebastián d’Anconia threw the contents of his wine glass at the face of the lord of Inquisition, and escaped before he could be seized. He left behind his fortune, his estate, his marble palace and the girl he loved–and he sailed to a new world.[^49]

>>>
Dagny and Eddie spent their winters trying to master some new skill, in order to astonish Francisco and beat him, for once. They never succeeded. When they showed him how to hit a ball with a bat, a game he had never played before, he watched them for a few minutes, then said. “I think I get the idea. Let me try.” He took the bat and sent the ball flying over a line of oak trees far at the end of the field.

When Jim was given a motorboat for his birthday, they all stood on the river landing, watching the lesson, while an instructor showed Jim how to run it. None of them had ever driven a motorboat before. The sparkling white craft, shaped like a bullet, kept staggering clumsily across the water, its wake a long record of shivering[^50], its motor choking with hiccoughs, while the instructor, seated beside him, kept seizing the wheel out of Jim’s hands. For no apparent reason, Jim raised his head suddenly and yelled at Francisco. “Do you think you can do it any better?” “I can do it.” “Try it!”

… The boat shot out to the middle of the river, as if fired from a gun. It was streaking away before they grasped what they were seeing … Dagny’s picture of it was three straight lines: its wake, the long shriek of its motor, and the aim of the driver at its wheel.[^51]
>>>

> The heirs of Sebastián d’Anconia had been an unbroken line of firsts sons, who knew how to bear his name. It was a tradition of the family that the man to disgrace them would be the heir who died, leaving the d’Anconia fortune no greater than he had received it. Throughout the generations, that disgrace had not come. An argentinian legend said that the hand of a d’Anconia had the miraculous power of the saints–only it was not the power to heal but the power to produce.[^52]

>>>
He seldom spoke in Francisco’s presence. But he would corner Dagny and he would smile derisively, saying, “All those airs you put on, pretending that you’re an iron woman with a mind of her own! You’re a spineless dishrag, that’s all you are. It’s disgusting, the way you let that conceited punk order you about. He can twist you around his little finger. You haven’t any pride at all. The way you run when he whistles and wait on him! Why don’t you shine his shoes?” “Because he hasn’t told me to,” she answered.

Francisco could win any game in any local contest. He never entered contests. He could have ruled the junior country club. He never came within sight of their clubhouse, ignoring their eager attempts to enroll the most famous heir in the world. Dagny and Eddie were his only friends. They could not tell whether they owned him or were owned by him completely; it made no difference; either concept made them happy.

The three of them set out every morning on adventures of their own kind. Once, an elderly professor of literature, Mrs. Taggart’s friend, saw them on top of a pile in a junk yard, dismantling the carcass of an automobile. He stopped, shook his head and said to Franciso, “A young man of your position ought to spend his time in libraries, absorbing the culture of the world.” “What do you think I’m doing?” asked Francisco.[^53]
>>>

>>>
“When I run d’Anconia Copper…“ “I’m studying mining and mineralogy, because I must be ready for the time when I run d’Anconia Copper…” “I’m studying electrical engineering, because power companies are the best customers of d’Anconia Copper…” “I’m studying philosophy, because I’ll need it to protect d’Anconia Copper...”

“Don’t you ever think of anything but d’Anconia Copper?” Jim asked him once.

“No.”[^54]
>>>

>>>
“Good God, Dagny! Do you expect me to be afraid of an object like James?”

It was days later, when they were alone… that she asked:
“Francisco, what’s the most deprived type of human being?”
“The man without a purpose.”[^55]
>>>

> “Dagny, there’s nothing of any importance in life–except how well you do your work. Nothing. Only that. Whatever else you are, will come from that. It’s the only measure of human value. All the codes of ethics they’ll try to ram down your throat are just so much paper money put out by swindlers to fleece people of their virtues. The code of competence is the only system of morality that’s a gold standard. When you grow up, you’ll know what I mean.”[^56]

>>>
“Mother, do they think it’s exactly in reverse?” she asked.
“What?” asked Mrs. Taggart, bewildered.
“The things you were talking about. The lights and the flowers. Do they expect those things to make them romantic, not the other way around?”
“Darling, what do you mean?”
“There wasn’t a person there who enjoyed it,” she said, her voice lifeless, “or who thought or felt anything at all. They moved about, and they said the same dull things they say anywhere. I suppose they thought the lights would make it brillant.”
“Darling, you take everything too seriously. One is not supposed to be an intellectual at a ball. One is simply supposed to be gay.”
“How? By being stupid?”[^57]
>>>

> “The government of the People’s State of Mexico has issued a proclamation,” he said, “asking the people to be patient and put up with hardships just a little longer. It seems that the copper fortune of the San Sebastián Mines was part of the plans of the central planning council. It was to raise everybody’s standard of living and provide a roast of pork every Sunday for every man, woman, child and abortion in the People’s State of Mexico. Now the planners are asking people not to blame the government, but to blame the depravity of the rich, because I turned out to be an irresponsible playboy, instead of the greedy capitalist I was expected to be. How were they to know, they’re asking, that I would let them down? Well, true enough. How they were to know it?”[^58]

> “Francisco! If you see what’s happening in the world, if you understand all the things you said, you can’t laugh about it! You, of all men, you should fight them!”
“Whom?”
“The looters, and those who make world-looting possible. The Mexican planners and their kind.”
His smile had a dangerous edge. “No, my dear. It’s you that I have to fight.”
She looked at him blankly. “What are you trying to say?”
“I am saying that the workers’ settlement of San Sebastián cost eight million dollars,” he answered with slow emphasis, his voice hard. “The price paid for those cardboard houses was the price that could have bought steel structures. So was the price paid for every other item. That money went to men who grow rich by such methods. Such men do not remain rich for long. The money will go into channels which will carry it, not to the most productive, but to the most corrupt. By the standards of our time, the man who has the least to offer is the man who wins. That money will vanish in projects such as the San Sebastián Mines.”[^59]

# Chapter 6 - The Non-Commercial

> This was his wedding anniversary and he had known for three months that the party would take place tonight, as Lillian wished. He had promised it to her, safe in the knowledge that the party was a long way off and that he would attend to it, when the time came, as he attended to every duty on his overloaded schedule. Then, during three months of eighteen-hour workdays, he had forgotten it happily– until half an hour ago, when, long past dinner time, his secretary had entered his office and said firmly, “Your party, Mr. Rearden.” He had cried, “Good God!” leaping to his feet; he had hurried home, rushed up the stairs, started tearing his clothes off and gone through the routine of dressing, conscious only of the need to hurry, not of the purpose. When the full realization of the purpose struck him like a sudden blow, he stopped.[^60]

> He could not stop the thing in his mind that went on throwing words at him; it was like trying to plug a broken hydrant with his bare hands. Stinging jets, part words, part pictures, kept shooting at his brain… Hours of it, he thought, hours to spend watching the eyes of the guests getting heavy with boredom if they were sober or glazing into an imbecile stare if they weren’t, and pretend that he noticed neither, and strain to think of something to say to them, when he had nothing to say– while he needed hours of inquiry to find a successor for the superintendent of his rolling mills who had resigned suddenly, without explanation– he had to do it at once– men of that sort were so hard to find– and if anything happened to break the flow of the rolling mills– it was the Taggart rail that was being rolled…[^61]

>>>
Lillian Rearden approached, her jewels glittering under the lights…

“It is this insistence of man upon meaning that makes him so difficult, “ said Dr. Pritchett. “Once he realizes that he is of no importance whatever in the vast scheme of the universe, that no possible significance can be attached to his activities, that it does not matter whether he lives or dies, he will become much more… tractable[^62]”.

He shrugged and reached for another canapé. A businessman said uneasily, “What I asked you about, Professor, was what you thought about the Equalization of Opportunity Bill. ”

“Oh, that?” said Dr. Pritchett. “But I believe that I made it clear that I am in favor of it, because I'm in favor of a free economy. A free economy cannot exist without competition. Therefore, men must be forced to compete. Therefore, we must control men in order to force them to be free.”[^63]

> “No, you cannot expect people to understand the higher reaches of philosophy. Culture should be taken out of the hands of the dollar-chasers. We need a national subsidy for literature. It is disgraceful that artists are treated like peddlers and that art works have to be sold like soap.”[^64]

> “Dr. Prittchet was telling us that nothing is anything.”… “He taught us that everything is something.”[^65]

# Chapter 7 - The Exploiters and The Exploited

>>> 
A tractor went past her, loaded with green-blue bolts. The sound of drills came as a steady shudder from far below, where men swung on metal cables, cutting the straight stone drop of the canyon wall to reinforce the abutments of the bridge. Down the track, she could see men working, their arms stiff with the tension of their muscles as they gripped the handles of electric tie tampers.

"Muscles, Miss Taggart," Ben Nealy, the contractor, had said to her, "muscles -that's all it takes to build anything in the world."[^66]
>>>

> She had doubled the price of her order. Rearden had sent two metallurgists to train Mowen's men, to teach, to show, to explain every step of the process, and had paid the salaries of Mowen's men while they were being trained.[^67]

> She looked at the spikes in the rail at her feet. They meant the night when she had heard that Summit Casting of Illinois, the only company willing to make spikes of Rearden Metal, had gone bankrupt, with half of her order undelivered. She had flown to Chicago, that night, she had got three lawyers, a judge and a state legislator out of bed, she had bribed two of them and threatened the others, she had obtained a paper that was an emergency permit of a legality no one would ever be able to untangle, she had had the padlocked doors of the Summit Casting plant unlocked and a random, half-dressed crew working at smelters before the windows had turned gray with daylight. The crews had remained at work, under a Taggart engineer and a Rearden metallurgist. The rebuilding of the Rio Norte line was not held up.[^68]

>>>
Sitting beside him in his car, she regretted that she had agreed. She looked at the streets of New York and thought of the race between metal and time, between the rails of the Rio Norte Line and the passing days. She felt as if her nerves were being pulled tight by the stillness of the car, by the guilt of wasting an evening when she could not afford wasting an hour. 

"With all those attacks on Rearden that one hears everywhere," said Taggart, "he might need a few friends."[^69]
>>>

> "A cup of coffee, please," she said... She glanced around her and thought, in habitual professional calculation, how wonderful it was that one could buy so much for a dime.[^70]

>>>
"It's dust, lady, all of it, dust and blood. Don't believe the dreams they pump you full of, and you won't get hurt."

"What dreams?"

"The stories they tell you when you're young -about the human spirit. There isn't any human spirit. Man is just a low-grade animal, without intellect, without soul, without virtues or moral values. An animal with only two capacities: to eat and to reproduce."[^71]
>>>

> "Man's only talent is an ignoble cunning for satisfying the needs of his body," said the old bum. "No intelligence is required for that. Don't believe the stories about man's mind, his spirit, his ideals, his sense of unlimited ambition."[^72]

>>> 
"Spirit?" said the old bum. "There's no spirit involved in manufacturing or in sex. Yet these are man's only concerns. Matter, -that's all men know or care about. As witness our great industries -the only accomplishment of our alleged civilization- built by vulgar materialists with the aims, the interests and the moral sense of hogs. It doesn't take any morality to turn out a ten-ton truck on an assembly line."

"What is morality?" she asked.

"Judgement to distinguish right and wrong, vision to see the truth, courage to act upon it, dedication to that which is good, integrity to stand by the good at any price. But where does one find it?"

The young boy made a sound that was half-chuckle, half-sneer:
"Who is John Galt?"[^73]
>>>

>>>
"Men are not open to truth or reason. They cannot be reached by a rational argument. The mind is powerless against them. Yet we have to deal with them. If we want to accomplish anything, we have to deceive them into letting us accomplish it. Or force them. They understand nothing else. We cannot expect their support in any endeavor of the intellect, for any goal of the spirit. They are nothing but vicious animals. They are greedy, self-indulgent, predatory dollar-chasers who-"

"I am one of the dollar-chasers, Dr. Stadler," she said, her voice low.

"You are an unusual, brilliant child who has not seen enough of life to grasp the full measure of human stupidity. I've fought it all my life. I'm very tired..."[^74]
>>>

> "The moment you announce that you're turning the Rio Norte Line over to me, the Taggart stock will rise. The bedbugs will stop crawling from out of unlikely corners, since they won't have the incentive of a big company to bite. Before they decide what to do about me, I will have the Line finished. And as for me, I don't want to have you and your Board to account to, to argue with, to beg permission from. There isn't any time for that, if I am to do the kind of job that has to be done. So I'm going to do it alone."[^75]

>>>
"What are you going to call your company?"
"Oh... Why, the Dagny Taggart Line, I guess."
"But... Do you think that's wise? It might be misunderstood. The *Taggart* might be taken as-"
"Well, what do you want me to call it?" she snapped, worn down to anger. "The Miss Nobody? The Madam X? The John Galt?" She stopped, she smiled suddenly, a cold, bright, dangerous smile. "That's what I'm going to call it: the John Galt Line."
"Good God, no!"
"Yes."[^76]
>>>

> "I am a simple beggar, Francisco, and I am begging you for money. I had always thought that one did not beg in business. I thought that one stood on the merit of what one had to offer, and gave value for value. This is not so any more, though I don't understand how we can act on any other rule and continue to exist. Judging by every objective fact, the Rio Norte Line is to be the best railroad in the country. Judging by every known standard, it is the best investment possible. And that's what damns me. I cannot raise money by offering people a good business venture: the fact that it's good, makes people reject it. There's no bank that would buy the bonds of my company. So I can't plead merit. I can only plead."[^77]

# Chapter 8 - The John Galt Line

> Is that what you want? Is it as simple as that? she thought, but knew that it was not simple. There was some unbreakable link between her love for her work and the desire of her body; as if one gave her the right to the other, the right and the meaning; as if one were the completion of the other -and the desire would never be satisfied, except by a being of equal greatness.[^78]

>>>
"I don't have to tell you what your offer means to Dagny, to me, to every decent person on Taggart Transcontinental. You know it. And you know you can count on us. But... but I think it's horrible that Jim Taggart should benefit, too -that you should be the one to save him and people like him, after they-"

Rearden laughed. "Eddie, what do we care about people like him? We're driving an express, and they're riding on the roof, making a lot of noise about being leaders. Why should we care? We have enough power to carry them along -haven't we?"[^79]
>>>

>>>
People said it because other people said it. They did not know why it was being said and heard everywhere. They did not give or ask for reasons. "Reason," Dr. Pritchett had told them, "is the most naive of all superstitions."

"The source of public opinion?" ... "There is no source of public opinion. It is spontaneously general. It is a reflex of the collective instinct of the collective mind."[^80]
>>>

> Dagny Taggart had announced that the first train would be not a passenger express loaded with celebrities and politicians, as was the custom, but a freight special. The freight came from farms, from lumber yards, from mines all over the country, from distant places whose last means of survival were the new factories of Colorado.[^81]

> A solitary figure stood at every mile post. Some were young schoolboys, others were so old that the silhouetes of their bodies looked bent against the sky. All of them were armed, with anything they had found, from costly rifles to ancient muskets. All of them wore railroad caps. They were the sons of Taggart employees, and old railroad men who had retired after a full lifetime of Taggart service. They had come, unsummoned, to guard this train. As the engine went past him, every man in his turn stood erect, at attention, and raised his gun in a military salute.[^82]

> She glanced at Rearden. He stood against the wall, unaware of the crowds, indifferent to admiration. He was watching the performance of the track and train with an expert's intensity of professional interest, his bearing suggested that he would kick aside, as irrelevant, any thought such as "They like it," when the thought ringing in his mind was "It works!"[^83]

# Chapter 9 - The Sacred and The Profane

> "What I feel for you is contempt. But it's nothing, compared to the contempt I feel for myself. I don't love you. I've never loved anyone. I wanted you from the first moment I saw you. I wanted you as one wants a whore -for the same reason and purpose. I spent two years damning myself, because I thought you were above a desire of this kind. You're not. You're as vile an animal as I am. I should loathe my discovering it. I don't. Yesterday, I would have killed anyone who'd tell me that you were capable of doing what I've had you do. Today, I would give my life not to let it be otherwise, not to have you be anything but the bitch you are. All the greatness that I saw in you -I would not take it in exchange for the obscenity of your talent at an animal's sensation of pleasure. We were two great beings, you and I, proud of our strength, weren't we? Well, this is all that's left of us -and I want no self-deception about it."[^84]

> Now I've broken an oath I gave for life. I had never committed an act that had to be hidden. Now I am to lie, to sneak, to hide. Whatever I wanted, I was free to proclaim it aloud and achieve it in the sight of the whole world... I'm going to have you at the price of more than myself: at the price of my self-esteem... I want no pretense about love, value, loyalty or respect.[^85]
