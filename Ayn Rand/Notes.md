# Chapter 1 - The Theme

> “I’m not going to requisition a new typewriter. The new ones are made of tin. There was an accident in the subway this morning, their brackets wouldn’t work. You ought to go home, Eddie, turn on the radio and listen to a good dance band. Forget it, boy. Trouble with you is you never had a hobby. Somebody stole the electric light bulbs again, from off the staircase, down where I live. I’ve got a pain in my chest. Couldn’t get any cough drops this morning, the drugstore on our corner went bankrupt last week. The Texas-Western Railroad went bankrupt last month. They closed the Queensborough Bridge yesterday for temporary repairs. Oh well, what’s the use? Who is John Galt?” [^1]

> In her pause of startled anger, the fireman chuckled. “Last week, the crack special of the Atlantic Southern got left on a siding for two hours– just somebody’s mistake.” [^2]

> "You realize, of course, that a lengthy procedure will be necessary to put this through,“ he said; the words sounded almost hopeful. “It isn’t as simple as that.”
“Oh sure,” she said. I’ll send you a detailed report, which Eddie will prepare and which you won’t read. Eddie will help you to put it through the works. I’m going to Philadelphia tonight to see Rearden. He and I have a lot of work to do.” She added, “It’s as simple as that, Jim”. [^3]

> “Would you take my word for it that I decided to offer you the post[^4] I’m going to offer, before you asked to see me? I want you to know that.”
“I will always take your word, Miss Taggart.”
“It’s the post of Superintendent of the Ohio Division. It’s yours, if you want it.”
His face showed no reaction, as if the words had no more significance for him than for a savage who had never heard of railroads.
“I don’t want it, Miss Taggart,” he answered. [^5]

> “Why?” she asked, not addressing him. 
He stopped. He shrugged and smiled– he was alive for a moment and it was the strangest smile she had ever seen: it held secret amusement, and heartbreak, and an infinite bitterness. He answered: “Who is John Galt?” [^5]

# Chapter 2 - The Chain

> An oncoming freight train hid the view, filling the windows with a rushing smear of noise. In a sudden break above the flat cars, the passengers saw distant structures under a faint, reddish glow in the sky; the glow moved in regular spasms, as if the structures were breathing. [^6]

> The metal came rising to the top of the ladle and went running over with arrogant prodigality. Then the blinding white trickles turned to glowing brown, and in one more instant they were black icicles of metal, starting to crumble off. The slag was crusting in thick, brown ridges that looked like the crust of the earth. As if the crust grew thicker, a few craters broke open, with the white liquid still boiling within. [^7]

> The road was dark, edged with trees. Looking up, he could see a few leaves against the stars; the leaves were twisted and dry, ready to fall. There were distant lights in the windows of houses scattered through the countryside; but the lights made the road seem lonelier. [^8]

> –the acts of self-racking when he discarded a hope or a sample, not permitting himself to know that he was tired, not permitting himself to know that he was tired, not giving himself time to feel, driving himself through the wringing of: “not good enough . . . still not good enough . . .” and going on with no motor save [^9] the condition that it could be done. [^10]

> –these were things that had come to white heat, had melted and fused within him, and their alloy was a strange, quiet feeling that made him smile at the countryside in the darkness and wonder why happiness could hurt. [^11]

> After a while, he realized that he was thinking of his past, as if certain days of it were spread before him, demanding to be seen again. He did not want to look at them; he despised memories as a pointless indulgence. But then he understood that he thought of them tonight in honor of that piece of metal in his pocket. Then he permitted himself to look. [^12]

> He saw the day when he stood on a rocky ledge and felt a thread of sweat from his temple down his neck… He stood, cursing himself, because he had made up to his mind that he would not be tired. After a while, he went back to his task; he decided that pain was not a valid reason for stopping. [^12]

> He saw an evening when he sat slumped [^13] across his desk in that office. It was late and his staff had left; so he could lie there alone, unwitnessed. He was tired. It was as if he had run a race against his own body, and all the exhaustion of years, which he had refused to acknowledge, had caught him at once and flattened him against his desk top. He felt nothing, except the desire not to move. He did not have the strength to feel –not even to suffer. He had burned everything there was to burn within him; he had scattered so many sparks to start so many things–and he wondered whether someone could give him now the spark he needed, now when he felt unable ever to rise again. He asked himself who had started him and kept him going. Then he raised his head. Slowly, with the greatest effort of his life, he made his body rise until he was able to sit upright with only one hand pressed to the desk and a trembling arm to support him. He never asked that question again. [^14]

> As he touched it, he realized suddenly that he had thought of an abstraction called “his wife” –not of the woman to whom he was married. He felt a stab of regret, wishing he had not made the bracelet, then a wave of self-reproach for the regret. [^15]

> He shook his head. This was not the time for his old doubts. He felt that he could forgive anything to anyone, because happiness was the greatest agent of purification. He felt certain that every living being wished him well tonight. He wanted to meet someone, to face the first stranger, to stand disarmed and open, and to say, “Look at me.” People, he thought, were as hungry for a sight of joy as he had always been– for a moment’s relief from that gray load of suffering which seemed so inexplicable and unnecessary. He had never been able to understand why men should be unhappy. [^15]

> “--but it’s just that a man of culture is bored with the alleged wonders of purely material ingenuity,” she was saying. “He simply refuses to get excited about plumbing.” [^16]

> “You’re not sorry. You could’ve been here if you’d made the effort. But when did you ever make an effort for anybody but yourself? You’re not interested in any of us or in anything we do. You think if you pay the bills, that’s enough, don’t you? Money! That’s all you know. And all you give us is money. Have you ever given us any time? [^17]

> They were all watching his face; if they expected a look of guilt, what they saw, instead, was a faint smile of amusement. She could not have intended this as a trap, he thought, because he could escape it so easily, by refusing to accept any blame for his forgetfulness and by leaving her spurned; she knew that his feeling for her was her only weapon. Her motive, he thought, was a proudly indirect attempt to test his feeling and to confess her own . . . He had to let her win, he thought, because she had thrown herself upon his mercy. [^18]

> She jingled the bracelet, making it sparkle under the light. "Henry, it's perfectly wonderful! What originality! I shall be the sensation of New York, wearing jewelry made of the same stuff as bridge girders, track motors, kitchen stoves, typewriters, and --what was it you were saying about it the other day, darling?--soup kettles? [^19]

> "The intention's plain selfishness, if you ask me," said Rearden's mother. "Another man would bring a diamond bracelet, if he wanted to give his wife a present, because it's her pleasure not his own. But Henry thinks that's just because he's made a new kind of tin, why, it's got to be more precious than diamonds to everybody, just because it's he who has made it. [^20]

> He had never asked anything of them; it was they who wished to hold him, they who pressed a claim on him-- and the claim seemed to have the form of affection, but it was a form which he found harder to endure than any sort of hatred. He despised causeless affection, just as he despised unearned wealth. They professed to love him for some unknown reason and they ignored all the things for which he could wish to be loved. He wondered what response they could hope to obtain from him in such manner--if his response was what they wanted... Why that chronic air of suspicion, as if they were waiting to be hurt? He had never had a desire to hurt them, but he had always felt their defensive, reproachful expectation; they seemed wounded by the mere fact of his being. Don't start imagining the insane--he told himself severely, struggling to face the riddle with the strictest of his ruthless sense of justice. He could not condemn them without understanding; and he could not understand. [^21]

> What would happen to Henry's vanity if he didn't have us to throw alms to? What would become of his strength if he didn't have weaker people to dominate? What would he do with himself if he didn't keep us around as dependents? [^22]

> She took the metal bracelet and held it up, letting it glitter in the lamplight. . . "A chain," she said. "Appropriate, isn't it? It's the chain by which he holds us all in bondage. [^23]

# Chapter 3 - The Top and The Bottom

> Disunity, that’s the trouble. It’s my absolute opinion that in our complex industrial society, no business enterprise can succeed without sharing the burden of the problems of other enterprises. [^24]

> “It’s been proved that every business depends upon every other business.” said Orren Boyle. “So everybody ought to share the burdens of everybody else.” [^25]

> “My purpose”, said Orren Boyle, “is the preservation of a free economy. It’s generally conceded that free economy is now on trial. Unless it proves its social value and assumes its social responsibilities, the people won’t stand for it. If it doesn’t develop a public spirit, it’s done for, make no mistake about that.” [^26]

> The only justification of private property is public service. [^27]

> “When everybody agrees,” . . . “when people are unanimous, how does one man dare to dissent? By what right? That’s what I want to know– by what right? [^28]

> “The public has a vital stake in natural resources, Jim, such as iron ore. The public can’t remain indifferent to reckless, selfish waste by an anti-social individual. After all, private property is a trusteeship held for the benefit of society as a whole.” [^29]

> “There’s nothing more destructive than a monopoly, on the one hand. On the other, there’s the blight of unbridled competition . . . The proper course is always, in my opinion, in the middle. So it is, I think, the duty of society to snip the extremes, now isn’t it?” [^30]

> “If everybody could pull for a common purpose, then nobody would have to be hurt!” [^31]

> “I can’t be expected to buck the trend of the whole world, can I?” . . . “You can’t Mr. Larkin,” said Wesley Mouch. “You and I are not to be blamed, if we–” [^32]

> “Speaking of progressive policies, Orren,” said Taggart, “you might ask yourself whether at a time of transportation shortages, when so many railroads are going bankrupt and large areas are left without rail service, whether it is in the public interest to tolerate wasteful duplication of services and the destructive, dog-eat-dog competition of newcomers in territories where established companies have historical priority.” [^33]

> “It all depends,” James Taggart answered slowly, “on knowing the people who make it possible . . . That’s what has to be known– who makes it possible” [^34]

> It was only in the first few years that she felt herself screaming silently, at times, for a glimpse of human ability, a single glimpse of clean, hard, radiant competence. She had fits of tortured longing for a friend or an enemy with a mind better than her own. But the longing passed. She had a job to do. She did not have time to feel the pain; not often. [^35]

> In a corner of the concourse, by the main entrance, there was a small newsstand. The owner, a quiet, courteous old man with an air of breeding, had stood behind his counter for twenty years. He had owned a cigarette factory once, but it had gone bankrupt . . . He had a hobby which was his only pleasure; he gathered cigarettes from all over the world for his private collection; he knew every brand made or that had ever been made. Dagny liked to stop at his newsstand on her way out. He seemed to be part of the Taggart Terminal, like an old watchdog too feeble to protect it, but reassuring by the loyalty of his presence. He liked to see her coming, because it amused him to think that he alone knew the importance of the young woman in a sports coat and a slanting hat, who came hurrying anonymously through the crowd. [^36]

>>> 
“Do they ever think?” she asked involuntarily, and stopped; the question was her one personal torture and she did not want to discuss it.
He said, “I don’t like the thing that’s happening to people, Miss Taggart.”
“What?”
“I don’t know. But I’ve watched them here for twenty years and I’ve seen the change. They used to rush through here, and it was wonderful to watch, it was the hurry of men who knew where they were going and were eager to get there. Now they are hurrying because they are afraid. It’s not a purpose that drives them, it’s fear. They’re not going anywhere, they’re escaping. And I don’t think they know what it is that they want to escape. They don’t look at one another. They jerk when brushed against. They smile too much, but it’s an ugly kind of smiling: it’s not joy, it’s pleading. I don’t know what it is that’s happening to the world.” He shrugged. “Oh, well, who is John Galt?” [^37]

# Chapter 4 - The Immovable Movers

> She felt a dim touch of anxiety. She was back from a trip to the plant of the United Locomotive Works in New Jersey, where she had gone to see the president of the company in person. She had learned nothing: neither the reason for the delays nor any indication for the date when the Diesel engines would be produced. The president of the company had talked to her for two hours. But none of his answers had connected to any of her questions. His manner had conveyed a peculiar note of condescending reproach whenever she attempted to make the conversation specific, as if she were giving proof of ill-breeding by breaking some unwritten code known to everyone else.

>>>
She turned to a phonograph and put on a record of the music of Richard Halley.

It was his Fourth Concerto, the last work he had written. The crash of its opening chords swept the sights of the streets away from her mind. The Concerto was a great cry of rebellion. It was a “No” flung at some vast process of torture, a denial of suffering, a denial that held the agony of the struggle to break free. The sounds were like a voice saying: There is no necessity for pain –why, then, is the worst pain reserved for those who will not accept its necessity?--we who hold the love and the secret of joy, to what punishment have we been sentenced for it, and by whom? . . . The sounds of torture became defiance, the statement of agony because a hymn to a distant vision for whose sake anything was worth enduring, even this. It was the song of rebellion–and of a desperate quest.
